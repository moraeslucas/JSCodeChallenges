   Your task is to create a movie object that takes in three arguments:
     -TITLE;
     -DIRECTOR;
     -GENRE. 
   The movie prototype should have a function called get overview, which logs the following overview for each film:
     -TITLE, GENRE film by DIRECTOR
   You can use a function syntax to create your prototype. Once you create your Movie object, create at least one movie to test it out.
