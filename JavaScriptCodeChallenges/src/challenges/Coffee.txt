   In this challenge, you should use the array reduce function to calculate the following:
    -Total bill from a trip with your friends to the coffee shop. More precisely, each person has ordered some number of coffees, and you offer to pay the entire bill.
   So, given an array of integers with each value is greater than zero, calculate the total price of all coffees where each one costs $1.25
   You should return your answer in the following format: 
    -The total bill is {followed by the total}.
   You should also use template literals (back ticks, etc.) for your return value.
