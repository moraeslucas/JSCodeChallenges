In this challenge you'll be developing an inventory application for a bookstore: 
   You need to create a book class, which provides information about different books in the store. Each book will have a...
     -title;
     -author;
     -and keep track of the number of available copies.
   You'll need a way to get each book's availability. If there aren't any copies of the book left, the function should return out of stock. Otherwise the function should return in stock. 
   You'll also need a function for selling a book. This will take the number of copies sold and subtract it from the total number of copies. If no argument is passed, we can default the number of copies to sell to one.
   You should use JavaScript's class keyword as well as a getter function for the availability method.
